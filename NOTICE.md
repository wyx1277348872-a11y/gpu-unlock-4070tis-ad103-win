## What is downloaded at install time and never distributed here

The installer downloads these files on the user's PC, checks each against the SHA-256 pinned in `installer/payload/manifest.json`, and unpacks them locally into `C:\ProgramData\GPU-Unlock\`. None of them, and nothing generated from them, is part of this repository or its releases.

| File | Source | Terms |
|---|---|---|
| `NVIDIA-kernel-module-source-610.43.03.tar.xz` | download.nvidia.com | NVIDIA open GPU kernel modules (MIT / GPL-2.0 dual license) |
| `nvidia-utils-610.43.03-1-x86_64_v3.pkg.tar.zst` | archive.cachyos.org (repackaged NVIDIA Linux driver) | NVIDIA driver license; contains the GSP firmware |
| `python-3.14.0-embed-amd64.zip` | python.org | PSF License; only used to run the extraction scripts |

The generated firmware files (`booter_load_ad102.bin`, `v67-ad102-610.43.03-four-plm.bin`, `gsp_ga10x.bin`, `gsp_boot_ad102.bin`, `gsp_boot_desc_ad102.bin`) and any ROM, PROM or capture dumps of a user's card must not be committed. `.gitignore` excludes them.
